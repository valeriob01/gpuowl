This is a simple test-case generator for PM1. Use like this:

python3 makeWork.py < pm1.txt > work.txt

This generates a file 'work.txt' containing work lines for GPUowl. Rename this file to 'worktodo.txt' and run GPUowl
(the run may take a very long time, but can be interrupted early).
Look into results.txt, and every result should produce a factor. Look for no-factor results:

grep NF results.txt

If you find any no-factors, first double-check whether they should have been found given the B1/B2. If they should and haven't been
found, please report a bug.
